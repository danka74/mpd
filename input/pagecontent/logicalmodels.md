### Logical data models

Logical data models or information models for EHDS are created by Xt-EHR project, and they are refined versions of eHN Guidelines data sets.  
This specification aims to conform to those logical models, and provide the FHIR profiles for these models.  

Please see logical models related to this use case in [**Xt-EHR Implementation Guide**](https://build.fhir.org/ig/Xt-EHR/xt-ehr-common/useCasePrescription.html).  

Logical models in IHE MPD Implementation Guide may differ due to a wider a scope, but no breaking differences should occur.


### Mappings to EHDS logical models

Implementation Guide will provide mappings to Xt-EHR (EHDS) logical models.
