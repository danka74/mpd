### The European context

The history of European collaboration in the health space is long, and prior to the start of the epSOS project (2008-2014), that was intended to work on the development, the pilot and the evaluation of the first cross-border eHealth service.

This long journey resulted in the first operational cross-border services for Patient Summary and ePrescription based on the HL7 CDA R2.0 standard in 2019 ( see [here](https://art-decor.ehdsi.eu/art-decor/decor-templates--epsos-) for the current MyHealth@EU CDA-based specifications), initially activated in a few countries and progressively extended on a voluntary basis. 

These services was initially identified as EHDSI (under CEF), recently renamed [MyHealth@EU](https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/electronic-cross-border-health-services_en).

A set of new "priorities" services, beyond Patient Summary and ePrescription, have been identified by the European commission to be progressively implemented for the cross-border services. Namely:
- Laboratory Report
- Images and Imaging Report
- (Hospital) Discharge Report

All the new services will be based on HL7 FHIR.
